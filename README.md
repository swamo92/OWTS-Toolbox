# OWTS-Toolbox

OWTS-Toolbox is a python toolbox intended to facilitate GIS calculation of statistics 
for Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems (OWTS) in specific watersheds for those who are
not GIS savvy. It is very simple and easy to use employing a select, clip, and summary 
statistics tool enabling the calculation of the number of a advanced or sub-standard septic 
systems located in a watershed sensitive to nitrogen loading. Example input data is 
provided in the "input_data.zip" file. To load the toolbox simply right-click the ArcToolbox
icon in ArcMap and select "Add Toolbox..." and navigate to the folder where the .pyt file 
is stored. Best of luck!
